# Manual Backend & Frontend Setup ( Dockers )

*docker compose setup is only usable if you wont run any dockerized challenges else use pm2*

# Manual Backend & Frontend Setup ( Dockers swarm )

for use with docker swarm, go to docker-compose and add 
```
    environment:
      - SECRET_TOKEN=<token>
      - MONGODB_CONNSTRING=mongodb://dbuser:changeme@mongo:27017/ctfDB?authSource=admin
      - BACKEND_URI=http://<backend>:3001/
      - DOCKER_URI=<ip-of-load-balancer-swarm>
      - RANDOM_FLAG_FORMAT="HNx03{RAND}"
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=<github token to access docker-compose in repo>
      - INSWARM=true
```
Then create a credsdocker.json file at the root of dockerAPI so that your container can authenticate itself to your registry and access your private repo.
```
{
        "auths": {
                "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
                        "auth": "<b64creds>"
                }
        }
}
```
The swarm is created outside CTFCaf√© and care must be taken to give your registry access to your master/slave swarm so that the images can be pulled.


# Manual Backend & Frontend Setup ( No Dockers )

## Prerequisites
- Node.JS
- MongoDB

## Setup
- copy `.env.example` to `.env` file in /backEnd/ and fill the info needed

- copy `.env.example` to `.env` file in /dockerAPI/ and fill the info needed

- copy `.env.example` to `.env` file in /frontEnd/ and fill the info needed

## Startup

`MongoDB`
- Start your mongoDB database
- If you're testing on Windows, you may need to download https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

`/frontEnd`
- Run `npm install` to install the requirements from `package.json`, then run `npm start` or `npm run start-react` for easier dev to start the frontend

`/backEnd`
- Run `npm install` to install the requirements from `package.json`, then run `npm start` to start & setup the backend

`/dockerAPI`
- Run `npm install` to install the requirements from `package.json`, then run `npm start` to start & setup the backend

`/discordBot`
- This is optional, but can be used to setup a bot for the CTF. See here: https://github.com/CTF-Cafe/CTF_Cafe/tree/master/discordBot

*You can use `pm2` if you want an easy way to handle the nodejs processes.*

Make sure to create a new account, promote him to admin and delete the admin:admin user after setup!

Good to go!
